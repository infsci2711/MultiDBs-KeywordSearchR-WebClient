 Keyword Search Relational project is a Google like keyword search through all registered stores based on relational index approach. We directly collaborates with MetaStore and PrestoDB Query projects. Datasource information is passed to us as parameter from Metastore team once a new database connection is added. Then our programs take actions to generate corresponding SQL queries and send them to PrestoDB team by requesting their REST service. After getting the query results from PresoDB, indexes are built for each entry in the databases for more efficient keyword search.
